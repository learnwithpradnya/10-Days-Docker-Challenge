## ⚙️ **What I Built**

🔹 **Python Flask App** – Handles web requests and displays live visitor count.  
🔹 **Redis Database** – Stores and updates the count persistently.  
🔹 **Dockerfile** – Defines the image for the Flask application (installs dependencies and runs the app).  
🔹 **Docker Compose** – Orchestrates both containers (Flask 🐍 + Redis 🟢) seamlessly.
